Welcome, young padawan, to the git-poetry exercise!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to work along with your team to complete reproduce the poetry provided in input.txt
Rules:
	- at the end, the output.txt file should contain exactly the verses in input.txt, in the same order
	- each verse should be commited as a single commit
	- you should attempt to integrate often with the master branch, after each commit
